# libhackit-v2
The backend for the Hackit list interpreter

This is not a useful piece of software. I created it for my own learning needs. However, it has done two things. It has taught me how to program
in the Rust language with great proficiency and it has forced me to think more deeply about how to design interpreters. I should really read a book
but this project has given me a good introduction and I am suprized that I got it this done.
